# Changelog
## v3.5.0 [upcoming]
**cart**
* Add convenience function to clone carts
* DefaultCartBehaviour now returns real cart clones to prevent data races on cart fields 
* API
  * **Breaking**: Update `DELETE /api/v1/cart` to actually clean the whole cart not only removing the cart items (introduces new route for the previous behaviour, see below)
  * Add new endpoint `DELETE /api/v1/cart/deliveries/items` to be able to remove all cart items from all deliveries but keeping delivery info and other cart data untouched
* Add new method `SumShippingGrossWithDiscounts` to the cart domain which returns gross shipping costs for the cart 
* When using the `ItemSplitter` to split items in items with single qty (`SplitInSingleQtyItems`) the split discounts are reversed to make splitting the row total stable.
* **Breaking**: `SumTotalTaxAmount` now takes taxes on shipping costs into account
* **Breaking**: Delivery discount sum calculations `SumTotalDiscountAmount`, `SumNonItemRelatedDiscountAmount`, `SumItemRelatedDiscountAmount` now take discount on shipping costs into account
  * Old calculation is now in `SumSubTotalDiscountAmount`.
* `CartService`
  * Add `UpdateAdditionalData` to be able to set additional data to cart
  * Add `UpdateDeliveryAdditionalData` to be able to set additional data to the delivery info
  * Introduce new [interface](cart/application/service.go) to be able to easier mock the whole `CartService`
  * Add auto generated mockery mock for the `CartService`
  * Add new field `PriceGross` of `shippingItem` to directly get the shipping cost incl tax (must be filled by cart adapter)
* GraphQL: 
  * Add new method `sumShippingGrossWithDiscounts` to the `Commerce_DecoratedCart` type
  * Add new field `sumShippingGross` to the `Commerce_DecoratedCart` type
  * Add new field `priceGross` to the `Commerce_Cart_ShippingItem` type

  * **Breaking**: `Commerce_Cart_UpdateDeliveryShippingOptions` mutation responded with slice of `Commerce_Cart_DeliveryAddressForm` which was incorrect as we don't process any form data within the mutation. It responds now rightly only with `processed` state.

**checkout**
* Introducing Flamingo events on final states of the place order process
* Introduce a max ttl for the checkout state machine to avoid polluting the redis with stale checkout processes, defaults to 2h
* API
  * In case of an invalid cart during place order process we now expose the cart validation result, affected endpoints:
    ```
    GET /api/v1/checkout/placeorder
    POST /api/v1/checkout/placeorder/refresh
    POST /api/v1/checkout/placeorder/refresh-blocking
    ```

**customer**

* GraphQL:
  * **Breaking**: Change `activeBase` of `Commerce_Product_PriceInfo` from `Float` to `Commerce_Price`

* The `AddToCartEvent` includes the current cart (with added product)
* The `ChangedQtyInCartEvent` includes the current cart (with updated quantities)

* Mark `CartReceiverService.RestoreCart()` as deprecated, use `CartService.RestoreCart()` instead,
  the cart adapter therefore needs to implement the `CompleteBehaviour` interface.
* Add `CartReceiverService.ModifyBehaviour()` to easily receive the current behaviour (guest/customer)

* Add `CompleteBehaviour` interface which ensures that the cart adapter offers Complete / Restore functionality
* Add `CartService.CompleteCurrentCart()` and `CartService.RestoreCart()` which rely on the new `CompleteBehaviour` interface

    * Add new `ContextStore` port to provide a storage for the place order process
        * Provide InMemory and Redis Adapter
    * Add new `TryLocker` port to provide an easy way to sync multiple order processes across different nodes
        * Provide InMemory and Redis Adapter
    * Breaking: Add new GraphQL mutations / queries to start / stop / refresh the place order process
    
**payment**
* Add `PaymentService` to easily work with bound PaymentGateway's
    * `PaymentService.AvailablePaymentGateways()` returns all bound gateways
    * `PaymentService.PaymentGateway()` gets the payment gateway by gateway code
    * `PaymentService.PaymentGatewayByCart()` gets the payment gateway of the cart payment selection

* Extend the `FlowStatus` struct with more standardized `FlowActionData`

**search**
* Extend `Suggestion` struct with `Type` and `AdditionalAttributes` to be able to distinguish between product/category suggestions

## v3.0.1
- Update dingo and form dependency to latest version

## v3.0.0
- general cleanups and linting fixes - that includes several renames of packagenames and types.
- price object introduced:
    - cart and product model don't use float64 anymore but a Price type
    - use commercePriceFormat templatefunc instead (core) priceFormat where you want to render a price object. This will automatically render a "Payable" price.
- cart module:
    - Has a new secondary port: PlaceOrderService
    - The meaning of DeliveryInfo.Method has changed! The former meaning is now represented in the property DeliveryInfo.Workflow. See Readme of cart ackage for details
    - The complete pricefields are changed! Check readme for details on the new price fields and methods
- checkout: 
    - removed depricated viewdata (CartTotals)
- products:
    - product category breadcrumb is not filled in controller - if you want a breadcrum you can use category data functions
    - product category fields are changed to use a categoryTeaser
- category:
    - Tree object uses a Tree Entity now which contains NOT all category properties. You have to fetch the category details separate on demand:
        - search for usages of the data funcs - they may need changes in rendering the data: `data('category´´..`
